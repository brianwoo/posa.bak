Intent Service already running in a separate thread.

For Started Service and Bound Service - need to create its own ThreadPool or use HandlerThread

Bound Service - can use regular handler to do message exchange (Messenger) or use AIDL.

AIDL (proxy and stub) - already has built-in thread support and support oneway (async) or twoway (synch) calls


Examples: UniqueIdGeneratorApplication (Bound Service - regular Handler - ThreadPool)
          AcronymApplication (Bound Service - AIDL)
          DownloadService (Started Service - regular Handler - HandlerThread)
